## Specific

* Styles applied to ids are more specific than classes and will win.

* Only use id-s if you have to (e.g. for Javascript integration)

* Last style definition wins

* A more specific selector will win over a less specific one. *ul li a* is more
specific than *li a*

* Avoid using *!important*  at all cost.
